Statement of work ( SOW ):
- During your work use the https://pokeapi.co/ REST API.
- List the different types of pokemons on the main screen. ( Use a dropdown
menu or picker )
- When one of the types is selected list all the pokemon names which are
assigned to this type. Include a searchbar on this screen, to able to search
pokemons by name.
- Upon selection of a pokemon, navigate to a profile card where you show some
details about the selected pokemon.
- The detailed profile card needs to include: a picture of the pokemon, the name,
weight, height, not hidden abilites.
- On the same screen implement a 'catch' button, on click, the pokemon should
be catched. You will need to mark the catched pokemons on the list. (exmaple:
green border, whatever...). When a pokemon is catched, the button should turn to
'release', if you want to release them back to the wild.
- Implement checkbox next to the searchbar to list only your catched
pokemons.
- Add some navigation to go back on the webpage, and do not fetch the data
again
- Use a loader / spinner while fetching data. (Loadingâ€¦).
Requirements:
- Angular framework with Flux state management (flux is optional but
recommended).
- For every component decide wisely if you need a class based component with
local states, or a functional component with hooks. (If you need help let me know)
- Usage of ES6
- Easy to read, DRY ( Do Not Repeat Yourself ) and well structured component
based code.
- Documentation with JSDocs, unless the code documents itself
- You can use any css library of your like, or you can write the whole on your
own.
